Throughout this assignment we've used NPM Package 
and Node Module as if they are the same, 
while there are similarities, how do they differ 
from one another?
-Modules are libraries for Node.js.
-A package is one or more modules grouped together.

If you create a new Node Module, 
how do you share that code with the community?
-This is done through creating a node repository locally.
